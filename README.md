a novel LTI system identification method

REQUIREMENTS:

- the excitation (input) signal should be periodical

HIGHLIGHTS:

1. estimate the system parameter and covariance matrices of noise altogether;
2. use time-domain data, but as fast as frequency-domain method;
3. only matrix operation used, easy to port into embedded environment.
